The problem:

Being able to tell a customer, at the moment he/she raises a new IT service request, how long he/she will have to wait for the request to be completed by the IT team (aka the request lead time), is a big step towards improving customer satisfaction.

The client previously tried to predict the lead time through hand-crafted predictions models but was not very successful. The problem was found to be too complex with various, partially unknown, factors affecting the results.

With AI being all over the news, the client is willing to give this problem another shot and hired your team to solve it. He provided you with historical request data of several hundred service requests.



The Goal:
Predict the Lead Time for all open IT service requests. The team with the lowest root mean square log error (RMSLE) between the lead time prediction and the actual lead time wins.
